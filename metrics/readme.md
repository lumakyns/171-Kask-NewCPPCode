# metrics - About the results

These results were obtained from an 8x8 board, with 3 rows of player pieces.

In Graphing, Performance.png shows the refactored code, without important changes to the underlying algorithm, doubles execution speed.

These results come from removing some unnecesary code design choices, such as copying boards multiple times over.

The original code, after 100 trials, did not get past 35 steps in a game. The refactored code did, which should be noted is pure coincidence.
